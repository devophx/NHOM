              <h2>The Secret To Successful Parenting<br><span>Rev. Rebecca Imende</span></h2>
              <p>Every strong building begins with a firm foundation; the deeper the foundation, the stronger the building. The foundation of every child is laid at home by the parents.
                <br>Mathew 7:24-27, tells us about two men: one built his house upon the sand and when the rain, the flood and the wind came that house was blown and had a great fall that was the end of it. The other man built his house on the rock and it stood firm all through those challenges. Successful parenting takes work, commitment and discipline, it is worth it because it pays in eternal dividend.  </p>
